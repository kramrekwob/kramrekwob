  After a decade immersed in the science of fermentation, I have turned my sights to full stack web development.  In the brewing industry I found I loved fixing machines, finetuning processes, dialing in our recipes, and talking with the people who loved our products.  Itching to go deeper than diagnosing mechanical problems, I’m now seeking a role where I can learn to troubleshoot software. I started with Javascript, then PHP and RESTful APIs. Currently learning front-end frameworks.  When I’m not coding I love beer, hiking, and live music.
