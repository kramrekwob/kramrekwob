  I am a software developer with a focus on responsive front-end web design. After a decade immersed in all things fermentation, I have turned my sights to full stack web development. In the brewing industry I loved creating recipes, fixing machines, fine-tuning processes, and talking with the people who loved what we made.  Itching to go deeper than diagnosing mechanical problems, I’m now seeking a role where I can make and troubleshoot software full time. I started with Javascript, then learned Node, Express, and MongoDB to build out the back-end. Currently honing my skills with front-end libraries like Bootstrap and frameworks such as React. When I’m not coding I love beer, hiking, and live music.
